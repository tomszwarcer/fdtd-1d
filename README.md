Finite difference time domain simulation of Maxwell's equations

## Outline

- Code for E, H field position and time generation.
    - Output will be two CSVs (E/H) with a column for time, and columns for x.
- Code to generate plots of E (or H) at each time
    - Using ROOT
- Code to put together the plots into an animation
    - Using Python
